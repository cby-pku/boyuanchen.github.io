I am a junior undergraduate majoring in Artificial Intelligence at Yuanpei College, [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/). 
  <br/>
I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Yaodong Yang](https://www.yangyaodong.com/) at the Institute for AI, PKU.

My research interests cover AI Alignment and Interaction (*e.g.*, scalable oversight, deception alignment and super alignment). My current research focuses on the goal of constructing safe and trustworthy AI systems. You can find my research statement [here](https://cby-pku.github.io//files/research_statement.pdf).

My answers to the [Hamming question](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html) (“What are the most important problems [that you should probably work on]?”): 
<ul>
<li>How to align systems smarter than humans and how to align them on tasks challenging for human evaluation? (<i>i.e.</i>, <b>scalable oversight</b>)</li>
<li>How can we integrate theory and experimental validation to embed moral values into AI systems? (<i>e.g.</i>, <b>moral reflection</b> and <b>moral progress</b>) and address the AI alignment problem from a <b>socio-technical</b> perspective.</li>
</ul> 

I have just started on this long road, and I will leverage my youth and curiosity to seize more opportunities and time for an in-depth exploration of these problems.
