I am a junior undergraduate majoring in Artificial Intelligence at Yuanpei College, [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/). 

I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Yaodong Yang](https://www.yangyaodong.com/) at the Institute for AI, Peking University.

My research interests cover Alignment and Interaction (e.g., Scalable Oversight, which is essential to the safety of advanced AI systems). I'm also interested in Game Theory and Multi-Agent Systems. My current research focuses on the goal of constructing safe and trustworthy AI systems. You can find my research statement [here](https://cby-pku.github.io//files/research_statement.pdf).

My answer to the [Hamming question](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html) (“What are the most important problems [that you should probably work on]?”): 
<ul>
<li>How to align systems smarter than humans and how to align them on tasks challenging for human evaluation? (<i>i.e.</i>, <b>scalable oversight</b>)</li>
<li>How can we integrate theory and experimental validation to embed moral values into AI systems? (<i>e.g.</i>, <b>moral reflection</b> and <b>moral progress</b>) and address the AI alignment problem from a <b>socio-technical</b> perspective.</li>
</ul> 

I have just started on this long road, and I will leverage my youth and curiosity to seize more opportunities and time for an in-depth exploration of these problems.
