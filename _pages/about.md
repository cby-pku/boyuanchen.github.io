I am a freshman undergraduate majoring in Artificial Intelligence at Yuanpei College, [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/). I am a member of [Tong Class](http://www.ai.pku.edu.cn/info/1086/1887.htm), an elite undergraduate program in Artificial Intelligence led by [Prof. Song-Chun Zhu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~sczhu/). 

I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Yaodong Yang](https://www.yangyaodong.com/) at the Institute for AI, Peking University.

My research interests cover Alignment and Interaction (e.g., Scalable Oversight, which is essential to the safety of advanced AI systems). I'm also interested in Game Theory and Multi-Agent Systems.
